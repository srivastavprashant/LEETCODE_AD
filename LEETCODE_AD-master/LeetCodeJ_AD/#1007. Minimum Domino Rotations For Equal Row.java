/*
    Approach : Question was a adhoc (as far as i think, it can be wrong) as there was no specific algo that came to my mind.
    ALGORITHM:
               1. A possible soln needs to be present in either of the array possibly both, given for every valid pos i. So arr1[0] and arr2[0] are valid candidates.
               2. As we need to give the minimun rotations we will store the counts that the candidate has occured in the array 1: arr1 and array 2: arr2.
               3. There is a possibility that there is no correct ans in that case we have taken two booleans that are true till there candidate remains a possible ans.
               4. If one of the candidate is in both the array at same location then obvious thing is that candidate two is no longer a soln. Moreover we will not increase the 
                  count of any array as both has the candidate so we wont require a rotation in any case.
                  
               Time complexity O(N)
               Space Complexity O(1)
